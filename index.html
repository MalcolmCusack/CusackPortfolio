		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p>
			Here starts my coding knowledge, so far so good. This will be the first website I've made from scratch. I am taking this bootcamp to learn the skills of front-end programming. I feel it is very faluable to understand how computers work, and how to work this them. In this day and age it is very important for everyone to know some coding. No matter what industy I go into, I know that programming skills will come in handy. It could set me apart in applications to jobs as well. Can't wait for Class to start!!!
